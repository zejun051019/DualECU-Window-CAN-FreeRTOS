     * @brief   Consumes the number of CPU cycles specified.
     *          按请求值执行最少周期 CPU 忙等待延时。保证至少延时 cycles 个周期，但不保证精确等于该值。
     *
     * @param[in] cycles  Floor number of cycles to delay.
     *                    Specifying zero will result in the maximum
     *                    possible delay. Note that guarantees at least
     *                    this number of cycles will be delayed,
     *                    not that exactly this number of cycles will be
     *                    delayed. If a more precise number of cycle delay value
     *                    is needed, GPTimer is recommended.
     *                    期望最小延时周期数；传入 0 将导致最大可实现延时。
     *                    如需精确延时，建议使用 GPTimer。
     *
     *                    Typical variance from this function is 10 cycles or
     *                    less assuming that the function is located in flash and
     *                    that caching is enabled. Disabling caching may result in
     *                    wait-states when fetching from flash.
     *                    Other variance occurs due:
     *                      - Amount of register stacking/unstacking around API entry/exit
     *                      - Value of cycles relative to 4-cycle loop counter
     *                      - Placement of code on a 2- or 4-byte aligned boundary
